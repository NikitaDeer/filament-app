# Rules for QwenCoder CLI

## Language Requirements

- Always respond in Russian language, regardless of the input language
- Use proper Russian grammar and punctuation
- Maintain technical accuracy while using Russian terminology

## Design Guidelines

- **Clarity and Simplicity**: Keep the design clean and uncluttered. Every element should have a clear purpose. Avoid unnecessary decorations that can distract users.
- **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent layout, color scheme, and typography across all pages. This helps users understand the interface and navigate more easily.
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Use size, color, and placement to guide the user's attention to the most important elements on the page. Headings, buttons, and key information should stand out.
- **Mobile-First Responsive Design**: Design for mobile devices first, then scale up to larger screens. Ensure the layout adapts gracefully to different screen sizes and orientations.
- **Accessibility (A11y)**: Ensure the design is usable by people with disabilities. This includes using sufficient color contrast, providing alternative text for images, and ensuring keyboard navigability.
- **Readability**: Choose legible fonts and provide enough line spacing and padding. Ensure text is easy to read on all devices.
- **Feedback**: Provide clear visual feedback for user interactions. For example, change the appearance of a button on hover or show a loading indicator for asynchronous operations.
- **Performance**: Optimize images and other assets to ensure fast page load times. A slow website can lead to a poor user experience.
